# Morgana Karolini

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, [morganakarolini.adv.br](https://morganakarolini.adv.br)!
This project serves as a showcase for my work, blog posts, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): The static site generator used to build this website.
- [blist-hugo-theme](https://github.com/apvarun/blist-hugo-theme): Blist is a clean and fast blog theme for your Hugo site.

## Website Structure

The website follows a simple structure:

- The content for the website, including blog posts and pages, can be found in the `content` directory.
- Configuration files for Hugo are located in the root directory.
- Static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript are stored in the `static` directory.
- The theme configuration and templates are located in the `themes/hugo-coder` directory.

## Local Development

To run the website locally:

1. Install Hugo by following the [official Hugo installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/pauloeli/pauloeli.dev.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pauloeli.dev`.
4. Start the development server: `hugo server`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:1313` to see the website.
